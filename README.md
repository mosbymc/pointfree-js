# queryable-js
A JavaScript library that allows queries to be performed against arrays the execution of which is deferred and lazily evaluated (where possible).

This is a work in progress - The 'master' branch has next to nothing in it currently; I am primarily working off the 'develop' branch until I have the core functionality implemented.
